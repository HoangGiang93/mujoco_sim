    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The DOLCE+DnS Ultralite
      ontology. It is a simplification of some parts of the DOLCE Lite-Plus library (cf.
      http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DLP397.owl). Main aspects in which DOLCE+DnS
      Ultralite departs from DOLCE Lite-Plus are the following: - The names of classes and relations
      have been made more intuitive - The DnS-related part is closer to the newer 'constructive DnS'
      ontology (http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/cDnS.owl). - Temporal and spatial
      relations are simplified - Qualities and regions are more relaxed than in DOLCE-Full: they can
      be used as attributes of any entity; an axiom states that each quality has a region -
      Axiomatization makes use of simpler constructs than DOLCE Lite-Plus - The architecture of the
      ontology is pattern-based, which means that DOLCE+DnS Ultralite is also available in modules,
      called 'content ontology design patterns', which can be applied independently in the design of
      domain ontologies (cf. http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org). If many modules are needed in a
      same ontology project, it is anyway useful to use this integrated version. The final result is
      a lightweight, easy-to-apply foundational ontology for modeling either physical or social
      contexts. Several extensions of DOLCE+DnS Ultralite have been designed: - Information objects:
      http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl - Systems:
      http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/SystemsLite.owl - Plans:
      http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/PlansLite.owl - Legal domain:
      http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/CLO/CoreLegal.owl - Lexical and semiotic
      domains: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L2.owl - DOLCE-Zero:
      http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl is a commonsense-oriented generalisation of
      some top-level classes, which allows to use DOLCE with tolerance against ambiguities like
      abstract vs. concrete information, locations vs. physical artifacts, event occurrences vs.
      event types, events vs. situations, qualities vs. regions, etc.; etc.</rdfs:comment>

    <owl:versionInfo rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Created by Aldo Gangemi
      as both a simplification and extension of DOLCE and Descriptions and Situations ontologies.</owl:versionInfo>
    <owl:versionInfo rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In 3.2, the links
      between instances of Region or Parameter, and datatypes have been revised and made more
      powerful, in order to support efficient design patterns for data value modelling in OWL1.0.
      Also, the names of the related properties have been changed in order to make them more
      intuitive. Furthermore, a large comment field has been added to the 'expresses' object
      property, in order to clarify some issues about the many interpretations. In 3.3, the relation
      between regions, parameters, and datatypes has been still improved. In 3.5, the person-related
      classes have been refactored: Person in 3.4 is now SocialPerson, to avoid confusion with
      commonsense intuition; Person is now the union of social persons and humans, therefore being a
      subclass of Agent. In 3.6, other fixes on universal restriction involving expresses. Also
      added the property 'isConstraintFor' between parameters and entities. Moved the properties:
      'assumes' and 'adopts' to the new module:
      http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/Conceptualization.owl. In 3.7, some fixes on the
      names of classes and properties related to FormalEntity; created a new separate module for
      general universal restrictions (DULGCI.owl). In 3.8, more fixes on the interface to formal
      entities and links to IOLite.owl. In 3.9, some naming and comment fixes. In 3.10, removed
      cardinality restriction from hasPart and isPartOf restrictions (changed to hasComponent and
      isComponentOf), for OWL(DL) compatibility. Also enlarged the range of includesAgent to contain
      both social and physical agents, and of conceptualizes universal restriction on agents, to
      include all social objects. In 3.11, some more subproperty axioms have been introduced, and
      all elements have got English labels. In 3.12, added some classes to map some old
      DolceLitePlus classes that were used to align OntoWordNet. In 3.13, added the LocalConcept
      class to express a Concept that cannot be used in a Description different from the one that
      defines it. Also updated some comments. In 3.14, added some comments. In 3.15, removed some
      owl:disjointWith axioms relating Collection to InformationObject, Description, Situation, and
      SocialAgent. The rationale for doing that is to allow less strict constraints on domain
      relations involving collections that can be also conceived as descriptions, situations, social
      agents, or information objects; for example: a collection of sentences from a text (an
      information object) that are ranked with a relevance criterion can be still considered a text.
      In 3.16, name of isActedBy changed to actsThrough, which is clearer. Also added
      SpatioTemporalRegion as constituted by a SpaceRegion and a TimeInterval. In 3.17, removed
      redundant universal axioms from Entity and other top classes. Fixed restrictions on
      FunctionalSubstance class, and comments in Design and Substance classes. In 3.18, removed
      subClassOf axiom from FunctionalSubstance to DesignedArtifact, created a new subclass of
      FunctionalSubstance, called DesignedSubstance, and created a subClassOf axiom from
      DesignedSubstance to DesignedArtifact. In 3.19, removed disjointness axiom between Concept and
      Collection (the same rationale applies as in 3.15 version. In 3.20, revised the comment for
      Quality, added InformationEntity as the superclass for InformationObject and
      InformationRealization (represented as the union of those classes). This is needed in many
      domain ontologies that do not need to distinguish between abstract and concrete aspects of
      information entities. One possible revision (not implemented here) would be to introduce the
      relations: expresses and isAbout with a broader domain:InformationEntity, and two more
      specific properties: abstractlyExpresses and isAbstractlyAbout. This last revision has not
      been implemented yet, since a large revision procedure should be carried out in order to check
      the impact of the revision on the existing DOLCE-DnS-Ultralite plugins. In 3.21, added comment
      to InformationEntity, and optimized representation of equivalence for InformationRealization.
      In 3.22, added comment to Personification. In 3.23, added associatedWith object property, and
      put all object properties as subproperties of it. In 3.24, removed hasProxy datatype property.
      In 3.25, generalized domain and range of hasComponent and isComponentOf. In 3.26, updated some
      comments in order to clarify or exemplify the concepts. In 3.27, added rdfs:isDefinedBy
      annotations for Linked Data browsers. In 3.28, broadened the universe of pre-/post-conditions
      to give room to events and states. In 3.29, added some properties to support DBpedia
      alignment: sameSettingAs (situational analogous to coparticipation), including relations
      originating e.g. from sharing kinship, ownership, or roleplaying situations. In 3.30,
      completed some domains and ranges (formerly owl:Thing, now dul:Entity), and added axiom:
      Organism subClassOf PhysicalAgent. In 3.31, added a restriction to Quality and one to Region
      in order to ensure the original DOLCE constraint of qualities being always associated with a
      region, and vice versa. These axioms do not however exclude a direct applicability of
      qualities or regions to any other entity. In 3.32, removed redundant union axioms and some
      restrictions, which spot a negative trade-off between expressivity and complexity. In 3.33,
      added the ObjectAggregate class, added two property chains for coparticipation and same
      situation setting, updated some comments, added an axiom to Transition. In 3.34, extended
      mereological support for parthood, introducing hasPropertPart (transitive) as a middle
      property between hasPart (transitive and reflexive) and hasComponent (asymmetric). This
      solution uses then "reflexive reduction" and "transitive reduction" design patterns (they
      allow to grant property characteristics through the superproperties, but not in the
      subproperties). Technically, mereology axioms would require that also hasProperPart be
      asymmetric, however a direct subproperty of an OWL non-simple property (hasPart) cannot be
      also asymmetric, hence the approximation. Added a n-ary parthood class in order to suggest an
      alternative pattern for time- (and space-)indexed part relations. In order to ensure that
      property characteristics hold also with parthood n-ary, a property chain is introduced which
      infers a direct dul:partOf property for each parthood individual. Added a
      dul:realizesSelfInformation propery in order to enable local reflexivity ('Self') axioms for
      all information realizations. In 4.0, some foundational changes are introduced. - Firstly, the
      temporally indexed versions of some properties are introduced as subclasses of Situation
      (following the n-ary relation pattern), so covering relations from DOLCE that were skipped
      because of their larger arity. - - Secondly, DS's Situation class is extracted from DOLCE
      top-level distinctions (it used to be a subclass of SocialObject), put as a primitive class
      under Entity, and not disjoint from any other class. Since we are relaxing the semantics of
      Situation, this change is fully compatible with previous versions of DUL. The reason for the
      change is that it may sound counterintuitive (as many have noticed) to assume a descriptive
      commitment for situations, but not for events or states. In fact, DS provides an
      epistemological commitment to an ontology, independently from its foundational distinctions. A
      situation operationalizes that epistemology, and it is better not to put it under any
      foundational distinction (event, object, fluent, etc.), leaving to the designer whether to use
      descriptions as epistemological lenses, and so generating a situation, or not. A consequence
      is that any entity, when 'framed' by (satisfying) a description, becomes a situation. We can
      still model entities as being in a situation's setting, and classified by a concept defined in
      a description.</owl:versionInfo>

    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This is a large comment
      field for those who want to investigate the different uses of the 'expresses' relation for
      modeling different approaches to meaning characterization and modeling. For example, in all
      these cases, some aspect of meaning is involved: - Beehive means "a structure in which bees
      are kept, typically in the form of a dome or box." (Oxford dictionary) - 'Beehive' is a
      synonym in noun synset 09218159 "beehive|hive" (WordNet) - 'the term Beehive can be
      interpreted as the fact of 'being a beehive', i.e. a relation that holds for concepts such as
      Bee, Honey, Hosting, etc.' - 'the text of Italian apiculture regulation expresses a rule by
      which beehives should be kept at least one kilometer away from inhabited areas' - 'the term
      Beehive expresses the concept Beehive' - ''Beehive' for apiculturists does not express the
      same meaning as for, say, fishermen' - 'Your meaning of 'Beautiful' does not seem to fit mine'
      - ''Beehive' is formally interpreted as the set of all beehives' - 'from the term 'Beehive',
      we can build a vector space of statistically significant cooccurring terms in the documents
      that contain it' - the lexeme 'Belly' expresses the role 'Body_Part' in the frame
      'ObservableBodyParts' (FrameNet) As the examples suggest, the 'meaning of meaning' is
      dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. One can hardly make a summary of
      the too many approaches and theories of meaning, therefore this relation is maybe the most
      controversial and difficult to explain; normally, in such cases it would be better to give up
      formalizing. However, the usefulness of having a 'semantic abstraction' in modeling
      information objects is so high (e.g. for the semantic web, interoperability, reengineering,
      etc.), that we accept this challenging task, although without taking any particular position
      in the debate. We provide here some examples, which we want to generalize upon when using the
      'expresses' relation to model semantic aspects of social reality. In the most common approach,
      lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of a term is
      a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). Another approach is provided by concept schemes
      like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', encoded as
      a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'. Still another approach is that of psychologists and
      cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a
      concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. A radically different approach is
      taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meanings of an
      information object are spread across the communication practices in which members of a
      community use that object. Another approach that tackles the distributed nature of meaning is
      assumed by geometrical models of semantics, which assume that the meaning of an
      InformationObject (e.g. a word) results from the set of informational contexts (e.g. within
      texts) in which that object is used similarly. The logical approach to meaning is still
      different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of
      individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an
      individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc.
      Finally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning
      is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a
      meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.
      These different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about
      different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized and modelled within
      DOLCE-Ultralite as follows (notice that such list is far from exhaustive): (1) Informal
      meaning (as for linguistic or commonsense semantics: a distinction is assumed between
      (informal) meaning and reference; see isAbout for an alternative pattern on reference) -
      Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses
      relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject
      that act as 'paraphrases' - Conceptual meaning (as for 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is
      modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of
      Concept - Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses
      relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description - Cognitive
      meaning (as for 'psychological' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation
      between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that
      isRealizedBy a mental, cognitive or neural state (depending on which theory of mind is
      assumed). Such states can be considered here as instances of Process (occurring in the mind,
      cognitive system, or neural system of an agent) - Cultural meaning (as for 'social science'
      semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of
      InformationObject and instances of SocialObject (institutions, cultural paradigms, norms,
      social practices, etc.) - Distributional meaning (as for geometrical models of meaning). Here
      it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any
      different instance of InformationObject that isFormallyRepresentedIn some (geometrical) Region
      (e.g. a vector space) (2) Formal meaning (as for logic and formal semantics: no distinction is
      assumed between informal meaning and reference, therefore between 'expresses' and 'isAbout',
      which can be used interchangeably) - Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional
      first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an
      instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor (in most
      cases) a Set; isGroundingFor is defined in the ontology:
      http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl - Modal formal meaning (as in
      possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance
      of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a Set, and which
      isPartOf some different instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a PossibleWorld This is
      only a first step to provide a framework, in which one can model different aspects of meaning.
      A more developed ontology should approach the problem of integrating the different uses of
      'expresses', so that different theories, resources, methods can interoperate.</rdfs:comment>

      (e.g. body-organ-tissue-cell) or ontological 'strata' (e.g. social-mental-biological-physical)
      are typical layerings. Intuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since
      layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not
      properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense. A
      desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical
      constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of
      parts. Example of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a
      person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. In all these examples, we notice a typical
      discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is
      conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is
      conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is
      conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it.</rdfs:comment>

      between any entities, e.g. 'the human body has a brain as part', '20th century contains year
      1923', 'World War II includes the Pearl Harbour event'. Parthood should assume the basic
      properties of mereology: transitivity, antisymmetry, and reflexivity (propert Parthood of
      course misses reflexivity). However, antisymmetry is not supported in OWL2 explicitly,
      therefore DUL has to adopt one of two patterns: 1) dropping asymmetry axioms, while granting
      reflexivity: this means that symmetry is not enforced, but permitted for the case of
      reflexivity. Of course, in this way we cannot prevent symmetric usages of hasPart; 2) dropping
      the reflexivity axiom, and enforce asymmetry: in this case, we would prevent all symmetric
      usages, but we loose the possibility of enforcing reflexivity, which is commonsensical in
      parthood. In DUL, we adopt pattern #1 for partOf, and pattern #2 for properPartOf, which seems
      a good approximation: due to the lack of inheritance of property characteristics, each
      asymmetric hasPropertPart assertion would also be a reflexive hasPart assertion (reflexive
      reduction design pattern). Subproperties and restrictions can be used to specialize hasPart
      for objects, events, etc.</rdfs:comment>

      information object and an Entity (including information objects). It can be used to talk about
      entities that are references of proper nouns: the proper noun 'Leonardo da Vinci' isAbout the
      Person Leonardo da Vinci; as well as to talk about sets of entities that can be described by a
      common noun: the common noun 'person' isAbout the set of all persons in a domain of discourse,
      which can be represented in DOLCE-Ultralite as an individual of the class: dul:Collection. A
      specific sentence may use common nouns with either a singular or plural reference, or it can
      even refer to all possible references (e.g. in a lexicographic definition): all those uses are
      kinds of aboutness. The isAbout relation is sometimes considered as reflexive, however this is
      semiotically inaccurate, because information can be about itself ('de dicto' usage, as in
      'John is four character long'), but it is typically about something else ('de re' usage, as in
      'John loves Mary'). If a reflexivity exists in general, it rather concerns its realisation,
      which is always associated with an event, e.g. an utterance, which makes the information
      denoting itself, besides its aboutness. This is implemented in DUL with the
      dul:realizesSelfInformation property, which is used with local reflexivity in the
      dul:InformationRealization class.</rdfs:comment>

      some layering of the world described by the ontology. For example, scientific granularities
      (e.g. body-organ-tissue-cell) or ontological 'strata' (e.g. social-mental-biological-physical)
      are typical layerings. Intuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since
      layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not
      properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense. A
      desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical
      constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of
      parts. Example of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a
      person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. In all these examples, we notice a typical
      discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is
      conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is
      conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is
      conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it.</rdfs:comment>

      isConstraintFor and Entity if the Parameter isParameterFor a Concept that classifies that

    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A datatype property that
      encodes values from a datatype for an Entity. There are several ways to encode values in DOLCE
      (Ultralite): 1) Directly assert an xsd:_ value to an Entity by using hasDataValue 2) Assert a
      Region for an Entity by using hasRegion, and then assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by
      using hasRegionDataValue 3) Assert a Quality for an Entity by using hasQuality, then assert a
      Region for that Quality, and assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by using hasRegionDataValue
      4) When the value is required, but not directly observed, assert a Parameter for an xsd:_
      value by using hasParameterDataValue, and then associate the Parameter to an Entity by using
      isConstraintFor 5) When the value is required, but not directly observed, you can also assert
      a Parameter for a Region by using parametrizes, and then assert an xsd:_ value to that Region,
      by using hasRegionDataValue The five approaches obey different requirements. For example, a
      simple value can be easily asserted by using pattern (1), but if one needs to assert an
      interval between two values, a Region should be introduced to materialize that interval, as
      pattern (2) suggests. Furthermore, if one needs to distinguish the individual Quality of a
      value, e.g. the particular nature of the density of a substance, pattern (3) can be used.
      Patterns (4) and (5) should be used instead when a constraint or a selection is modeled,
      independently from the actual observation of values in the real world.</rdfs:comment>

      AgeRangeForDrugUsage could parametrize data value: 14 to 50 on the datatype: xsd:int. Since
      complex datatypes are not allowed in OWL1.0, a solution to this can only work by creating two
      'sub-parameters': MinimumAgeForDrugUsage (that hasParameterDataValue 14) and
      MaximumAgeForDrugUsage (that hasParameterDataValue 50), which are components of (cf.
      hasComponent) the main Parameter AgeRangeForDrugUsage. Ordering on subparameters can be

      actedBy agents that are (and act as) members of a Collective. A collective agent can have
      roles that are also roles of those agents. For example, in sociology, a 'group action' is the
      situation in which a number of people (that result to be members of a collective) in a given
      area behave in a coordinated way in order to achieve a (often common) goal. The Agent in such
      a Situation is not single, but a CollectiveAgent (a Group). This can be generalized to the
      notion of social movement, which assumes a large Community or even the entire Society as
      agents. The difference between a CollectiveAgent and an Organization is that a Description
      that introduces a CollectiveAgent is also one that unifies the corresponding Collective. In
      practice, this difference makes collective agents 'less stable' than organizations, because
      they have a dedicated, publicly recognizable Description that is conceived to introduce them.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Any physical, social, or
      mental process, event, or state. More theoretically, events can be classified in different
      ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement,
      etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g.
      human, physical, abstract, food, etc.). Here no special direction is taken, and the following
      explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views
      at a same time. If a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based
      classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.
      (1) Alternative aspectual views Consider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it
      can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an
      achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we
      collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something
      that has changed from a state to a different one). In the erosion case, we could therefore
      have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual
      focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality). The different views refer to the
      same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? A typical solution
      e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18
      axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would
      create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the
      modeller's attitude. An alternative solution is suggested here, and exploits the notion of
      (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be
      observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an
      observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where
      each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity.
      For example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a
      process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such
      view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly,
      ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed
      a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different
      Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'. Consider that in no case the
      actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view. (2) Alternative
      intentionality views Similarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be
      provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by
      immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those
      natural forces. Also in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the
      causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description
      is taken for interpreting the Event. On the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent
      causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its
      identity change, because we are adding a part to it. Therefore, if intentionality is a
      criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider
      causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity. (3) Alternative participant views A
      slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case,
      the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on
      them. For example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche
      basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the
      identity of an avalanche change. Anyway, this approach to event classification is based on the
      designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see.
      e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets). Ultimately, this discussion has no end, because
      realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we
      describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true
      reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and
      describe it. Both positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on
      issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which assist
      domain experts in representing a certain portion of reality according to their own assumptions
      and requirements. For this reason, in this ontology version of DOLCE, both events and
      situations are allowed, together with descriptions (the reason for the inclusion of the DS
      framewrok in DOLCE), in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position
      (if any) chosen by the model designer.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Entities that are formally
      defined and are considered independent from the social context in which they are used. They
      cannot be localized in space or time. Also called 'Platonic entities'. Mathematical and
      logical entities are included in this class: sets, categories, tuples, costants, variables,
      etc. Abstract formal entities are distinguished from information objects, which are supposed
      to be part of a social context, and are localized in space and time, therefore being (social)
      objects. For example, the class 'Quark' is an abstract formal entity from the purely
      set-theoretical perspective, but it is an InformationObject from the viewpoint of ontology
      design, when e.g. implemented in a logical language like OWL. Abstract formal entities are
      also distinguished from Concept(s), Collection(s), and Description(s), which are part of a
      social context, therefore being SocialObject(s) as well. For example, the class 'Quark' is an
      abstract FormalEntity from the purely set-theoretical perspective, but it is a Concept within
      history of science and cultural dynamics. These distinctions allow to represent two different
      notions of 'semantics': the first one is abstract and formal ('formal semantics'), and
      formallyInterprets symbols that are about entities whatsoever; for example, the term 'Quark'
      isAbout the Collection of all quarks, and that Collection isFormalGroundingFor the abstract
      class 'Quark' (in the extensional sense). The second notion is social, localized in space-time
      ('social semantics'), and can be used to interpret entities in the intensional sense. For
      example, the Collection of all quarks isCoveredBy the Concept 'Quark', which is also expressed
      by the term 'Quark'.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>A special kind of Situation that allows to include time indexing for the hasPart
      relation in situations. For example, if a Situation s 'finally, my bike has a luggage rack'
      isSettingFor the entity 'my bike' and the TimeIntervals 'now', or more specifically
      '29March2021', we need to have a time-index the part relation. With Parthood, we use
      includesWhole and includesPart properties. This can be done similarly for other arguments of
      parthood, e.g. location, configuration, topology, etc. Concerning the possible property
      characteristics reused from mereology (transitivity, asymmetry, reflexivity), they need to be
      implemented by means of rules (or, in a limited way, property chains using the binary hasPart
      or hasProperPart properties). A key is also added to ensure identification constraints of
      time-indexed parthood.</rdfs:comment>

      (but not a part of it), which cannot exist without that Entity. For example, the way the
      surface of a specific PhysicalObject looks like, or the specific light of a place at a certain
      time, are examples of Quality, while the encoding of a Quality into e.g. a PhysicalAttribute
      should be modeled as a Region. From the design viewpoint, the Quality-Region distinction is
      useful only when individual aspects of an Entity are considered in a domain of discourse. For
      example, in an automotive context, it would be irrelevant to consider the aspects of car
      windows for a specific car, unless the factory wants to check a specific window against design
      parameters (anomaly detection). On the other hand, in an antiques context, the individual
      aspects for a specific piece of furniture are a major focus of attention, and may constitute
      the actual added value, because the design parameters for old furniture are often not fixed,
      and may not be viewed as 'anomalies'.</rdfs:comment>

      that creates a context for three TimeInterval(s), two additional different Situation(s), one
      Event, one Process, and at least one Object: the Event is observed as the cause for the
      transition, one Situation is the state before the transition, the second Situation is the
      state after the transition, the Process is the invariance under some different transitions
      (including the one represented here), in which at least one Object is situated. Finally, the
      time intervals position the situations and the transitional event in time. This class of
      situations partly encodes the ontology underlying typical engineering algebras for processes,
      e.g. Petri Nets. A full representation of the transition ontology is outside the expressivity
      of OWL, because we would need qualified cardinality restrictions, coreference, property
      equivalence, and property composition.</rdfs:comment>
